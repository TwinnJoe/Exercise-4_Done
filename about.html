            <p>For a very long time, the standards of beauty weren’t inclusive of all women and their hair. Women were shown narrow ideals of beauty to look up to. We say that's enough.

                Our mission is to inspire all women to express their personal style. To champion them to be the most powerful they can be.
                
                For this mission to come to life, we’ve set up programmes to reflect our commitment to a more inclusive and representative society.
                
                We have:
                
                Appointed the Hair Advisory Board. These well-informed experts, who are passionate about positive transformation in various fields, guide us to make sure that we prioritise diversity and inclusion in the work that we do.
                Committed to communicating about all hair in a positive way, focusing on the benefits of our products.
                Committed to improving the lives and businesses of hairstylists nationwide through the TRESemmé Stylist Training Programme. This platform provides stylists with further education and skills development from experienced hair and business experts.
                Launched the TRESemmé Salon Programme. Hairstylists all over the country have been able to receive support by being given the necessary tools and products to help their businesses grow.
                Women don't have to live in a world where they have to mould their hair to fit into unrealistic ideals, telling them what to look like and who to be. We believe that the future of the hair industry should be one that uplifts women.
                
                One that is inclusive and acknowledges the power women hold. We will always cater to the diverse needs of all South African women and their hair. We will support and give them the tools they need to be who they want to be. We commit to continue using hair as a force for good. Now and always.</p>

            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading2" style="text-align: center;">Our Purpose</h1>
            <br>

            <img src="/images/about-2.avif" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
            <br><br>
            <p>We want every woman to look and feel inspired. To know and see that we acknowledge their expression of personal style.

                To make sure we get it right and that our programmes are truly representative, we have worked closely with several leading experts in diversity and inclusion, all of whom make up our Hair Advisory Board.
                
                 
                <h4>The Hair Advisory Board</h4>
                <br>
                The Hair Advisory Board is appointed to help guide us through how we should represent all women; from how we communicate with them to how TRESemmé products can give them the best care for their hair.
                 
                <h4>The TRESemmé Salon Programme</h4>
                <br>
                We will continue investing in and growing the TRESemmé Salon programme, an initiative we started in 2019 to give hairstylists and salon owners nationwide the support they need to care for all hair types and grow their businesses.
                 
                <h4>The TRESemmé Stylist Training Programme</h4>
                <br>
                To give stylists a better understanding of afro-textured hair, we launched The TRESemmé Stylist Training Programme. With this initiative, we are ensuring that all hairstylists and salon owners benefit from best practices shared amongst the professional hair industry.
                 
                
                Through our programmes we want to uplift the hair industry. To be an industry that celebrates every woman and all hair in South Africa. One that gives women the opportunities to grow their businesses. One that gives women all the tools they need to express their personal style.
                
                At TRESemmé, we hear you. We see you. And we are here to champion you to express your personal style and your power.
                
                 
                <h4>The Hair Advisory Board</h4>
                <br>
                Every woman deserves to be celebrated. Every woman deserves to look at the world around them and see themselves reflected back. That is why we have appointed the Hair Advisory Board to work closely together with us on all future campaigns.
                
                On this board sits a diverse and well-informed group of experts who help make sure that our programmes are inclusive and representative. In addition, our partnership has established initiatives that will give hairstylists with small professional salons the support they need to grow their business and build on their skills. 
                
                 
                <h4>The TRESemmé Stylist and Salon Programme</h4>
                <br>
                For all hairstylists who are passionate about making women feel and look good about their hair, the TRESemmé Stylist and Salon programme have been created.
                
                The TRESemmé Stylist Training Programme provides many aspiring stylists with the tools and training needed to help boost their business and skills, especially the techniques needed to style afro-textured hair. All hairstylists deserve to study a craft that they are passionate about without worrying about funding.
                
                The TRESemmé Salon Programme has been underway since 2019. The programme provides stylists with the support needed to grow their businesses in the form of products, branding and PPE to protect themselves and their clients from the spread of Covid-19.
                
                TRESemmé is committed to continue its support for these programmes and the benefits it brings to the wider hair industry.
                
                More details on the application to both programmes will be announced soon.
                
                 
                <h4>Our Positive Beauty Approach</h4>
                <br>
                We believe in Positive Beauty. We also believe in making sure that all women have everything they need to be the best versions of themselves, inside and out. So, we will continue developing, innovating, and evolving our products to cater for all hair needs. 
                
                We have changed the way we speak about hair on our products and in our advertising by focusing on the benefits rather than the challenges. We will continue to help build a more inclusive hair industry, not just through our product ranges but also through our ongoing support and funding for stylists that have dedicated their talent, passion and craft to making sure women across the country look and feel good.
                
                We will create an industry that continues to give entrepreneurs the opportunities they need, to make real change every day.
                
                 
                <h4> The TRESemmé of The Future</h4>
               <br>
                It really takes a community to take a stand and work towards a new and inclusive era of beauty. An era where women confidently express themselves and be who they want to be. An era where women are given the support they need to reach their aspirations. To support this new era, we will continue innovating and evolving our product ranges to meet all hair needs. 
                
                While working towards growing the hair industry, we will keep funding hairstylists to continue creating a progressive hair industry. We believe that with all the commitments we’ve made, we will make a real change - to make hair a force for good for all women.</p>

            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading3" style="text-align: center;">Bringing you salon quality hair at home since 1948</h1>
            <br>

            <img src="/images/about-3.avif" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
            <br><br>
            <p>TRESemmé understands how great hair gives you the confidence to walk taller every day. Delivering that feeling has driven TRESemmé since Edna L. Emmé founded the brand in 1948. She embodied this confidence; the perfect role model for inspiring modern women today. Intelligent and beautiful, Edna was a rule breaker and entrepreneur, a powerful package who was admired for her beauty but remembered for her intelligence and tenacity. It was Edna who had the vision to bring professional-quality hair to women at home – making hair history by introducing TRESemmé to the public.

<br>
                For decades TRESemmé has been driven by a simple truth: everyone deserves to look and feel fabulous - like they’ve just stepped out of the salon. The brand is dedicated to creating haircare and styling products that are salon-quality without the salon price. TRESemmé is a range of salon-inspired, stylist-tested products that help you create your own style to experience that salon feeling every day.</p>
